# üìß SMS Spam Detection using NLP Techniques

This repository compares various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detecting spam messages in SMS data. The project implements both traditional and modern NLP models, demonstrating their effectiveness for classification tasks. The dataset used is publicly available and the methods are implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like `sklearn`, `nltk`, and `gensim`.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Notebooks:**
  - `Spam Ham Classification Project BOW, TF-IDF.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the use of **Bag of Words (BOW)** and **TF-IDF** for text vectorization.
  - `Spam Ham Project Using Word2Vec, AvgWord2Vec.ipynb`: Explores word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **Average Word2Vec** for spam detection.

- **Data:** SMS spam dataset for classification, available in CSV format.

## üß™ Key Features

- Comparison of **traditional NLP methods** (Bag of Words, TF-IDF) and **word embeddings** (Word2Vec, Average Word2Vec).
- Hands-on classification models built using **logistic regression**, **naive bayes**, and **SVM**.
- Evaluation using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** metrics.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamgopinathbehera/SMS-Spam-Detection-NLP-Techniques-Comparison.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the different NLP techniques.

## üìä Results

- **BOW/TF-IDF** methods achieved high precision in detecting spam.
- **Word2Vec** models demonstrated strong performance in capturing contextual information.
- Detailed comparison and visualizations are included in the notebooks.
